# kalman-filter
An explainer on using Kalman filters for stochastic inference.

This explainer is largely based on this paper[^1] by _Mohamed Laaraiedh_.
More information on Kalman Filters can be found here[^2].
The data used in this explainer is the T-Drive trajectory data sample[^3] from Microsoft Research.
