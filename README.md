# kalman-filter
An explainer on using Kalman filters for stochastic inference.

This explainer is largely based on this paper[^1] by _Mohamed Laaraiedh_, and this book[^2] by _Roger Labbe_.
More information on Kalman Filters can be found here[^3].
The data used in this explainer is the Wall-Following Robot Navigation data set[^4] from the UCI Machine Learning Repository[^5].
